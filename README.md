# Playing the dog
Hunting for apples.

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=your-github-username)

Eat apples and score points. But not everything is so simple!

On your way there will be scavengers who are eager to pick up apples for themselves and stop you.

Your task is not to get caught by them! The more apples you eat, the more scavengers there will be who really want to catch you. Don't forget about it!
